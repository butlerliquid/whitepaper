# Abstract

ButlerLiquid is a project that connects the Butler ACP on the Virtual Protocol with HyperLiquid. It merges Butler's smart transaction capabilities with HyperLiquid's speed and market depth, creating a unified experience for users operating within the Virtual Protocol environment.

The objective is clear: allow traders in the Virtual ecosystem to effortlessly tap into HyperLiquid's liquidity and performance, delivering a trading experience that is both intuitive and powerful.

In essence, ButlerLiquid unites Butler's intelligence with HyperLiquid's liquidity, using the $BL token as the fuel that powers this connection.

# Introduction

ButlerLiquid is built to deliver smooth, intelligent trading within the Virtual ecosystem by linking the Butler ACP system with HyperLiquid's liquidity infrastructure. Through the Butler ACP, users can interact directly with the Butler agent to open, adjust, or monitor positions in real time, supported by context aware guidance.

The platform prioritizes fast, informed decision making, enabling users to respond immediately to market movements. Looking ahead, ButlerLiquid aims to enable autonomous agents to execute trades, manage perpetual positions, and collaborate with other agents, all while utilizing HyperLiquid's deep liquidity.

Future developments may explore enhanced payment solutions to further streamline the trading experience. In summary, ButlerLiquid offers a smart and interactive environment for both human traders and autonomous agents.

# Vision

Our vision is to create a seamless and intelligent trading ecosystem where human users and autonomous agents can interact, manage positions, and access liquidity across Virtual and HyperLiquid without friction.

# Mission

Our mission is to equip traders with fast, efficient, and context aware tools via Butler ACP, enable autonomous agents to optimize trading strategies, and continuously evolve our platform for a next generation trading experience.

# The Problem

Current trading in the Virtual ecosystem faces several issues:

- Fragmented access to liquidity: Users find it difficult to move assets between platforms efficiently.
- Manual and slow decision making: Managing positions across different protocols is often cumbersome and prone to errors.
- Limited agent integration: Autonomous agents lack a seamless way to coordinate and execute trades.
- Platform interoperability: Users face challenges when navigating between different trading environments.

# The Solution

ButlerLiquid addresses these challenges by offering:

- Seamless asset transfer: Users transfer assets to the Butler agent, which relays them to HyperLiquid through a secure relay system. Assets are maintained per wallet for full transparency.
- Context aware trading: Users manage positions via Butler ACP, while HyperLiquid Builder Codes execute trades from our dedicated account.
- Community incentive model: The platform rewards active participants through transparent revenue sharing with early users, token holders, and NFT owners.
- NFT based benefits and community rewards: A collection of 256 NFTs grants holders special privileges and rewards active platform users, token holders, and ButlerLiquid participants.
- Secure and automated ecosystem: Wallet security is managed through Privy, bridging is handled via relay, trading is executed on HyperLiquid, and end users interact through the Virtuals Butler client.

# Core Features

- Wallet Management via Privy: Users keep control of their assets securely while using ButlerLiquid.
- Relay System: Enables secure asset transfers between Butler ACP and HyperLiquid.
- HyperLiquid Integration: Executes trades, perpetual positions, and market operations via HyperLiquid Builder Codes.
- Context Aware Butler Agent: Users communicate with Butler ACP to manage positions intelligently and in real time.
